- 👋 Hi, I’m @syataheri
- 👀 I’m interested in programming especially in backend codeing with Node.js.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the deep concepts of node. I want to learn about db's SQL NoSQL and learn diffrent architecture.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend projects and everything that has new challengs.
